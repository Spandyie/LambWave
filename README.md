# LambWave
Using Sparse-autoencoders on Lamb wave sensor data to predict size of the defect on concretes.
Sparse Autoencoders are also known as autoassociative neural network. The contribution of this research is to identify Neural-network based feature and use of exponential regression to derive a calibration curve to predict relationship between Damage Index and Gap size.
